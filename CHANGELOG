v0.7.0. Switch to using ActiveSupport JSON instead of the JSON gem.  The JSON gem would not play nice with ActiveSupport's to_json within Rails projects, so the JSON gem had to go.  This means timestamps are returned as real Time objects instead of strings.

v0.6.2. Capture private flag and parse it to boolean from string

v0.6.0. Update for latest Github json spec; maintain backwards compatibility to avoid breaking stuff

v0.5.8. Prep for release

v0.5.0. Initial public release

v0.0.1. Internal release
